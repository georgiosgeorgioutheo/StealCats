Architecture and Technologies Used in StealCats Project
This document outlines the architecture, key technologies, and design considerations used in the StealCats project.

Architecture Overview
Clean Architecture
The StealCats project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which emphasizes separation of concerns and independence of business logic from external frameworks. The architecture is divided into the following layers:

Core Layer: Contains the business logic, entities, and interfaces. This layer is independent of any external frameworks and is at the center of the architecture.
Application Layer: Contains application services that implement business use cases. It interacts with the Core layer and coordinates operations across the system.
Infrastructure Layer: Responsible for data persistence, external API communication, and other external concerns. This layer implements interfaces from the Core layer.
API Layer: This is the entry point for the application, using ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs to expose endpoints to clients.
Key Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs
The project uses ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs to build lightweight and high-performance endpoints.
Minimal APIs offer a more streamlined approach compared to traditional controllers, making it easy to build small, focused services.
Global Exception Handling
A global exception handler is implemented to catch and handle exceptions consistently across the application.
This helps in providing meaningful error messages to the client and ensures that the application doesn't crash unexpectedly.
Serilog
Serilog is used for structured logging throughout the application.
Logs are essential for tracking application behavior, troubleshooting issues, and monitoring production environments.
Serilog allows for logging to various outputs (e.g., files, databases, logging platforms) and supports structured data.
FluentValidation
FluentValidation is used for validating request data and entities.
Validators are defined for each DTO and entity, ensuring that only valid data enters the business logic layer.
This reduces the risk of data-related errors and ensures consistency in data handling.
Testing
The project includes unit tests for various components, ensuring that the business logic, validation, and data processing work as expected.
xUnit is used as the testing framework, along with FluentAssertions for readable assertions and FluentValidation.TestHelper for testing validation logic.
Design Considerations
Separation of Concerns
Each layer of the architecture has a clear responsibility, ensuring that changes in one layer do not affect others.
Business logic is isolated in the Core layer, making it easier to maintain and test.
Dependency Injection
The project leverages ASP.NET Core’s built-in dependency injection to manage service lifetimes and dependencies.
This approach ensures that components are loosely coupled and easier to replace or modify.
Validation Rules
All validation rules are enforced using FluentValidation, ensuring that data integrity is maintained across the application.
This includes validation for request data, entities, and service inputs.
Error Handling
A centralized global exception handler ensures that errors are managed consistently, and clients receive meaningful feedback.
This also helps in logging errors and monitoring application health.
Scalability and Maintainability
The project is designed with scalability in mind, following best practices for Clean Architecture.
The separation of concerns and use of interfaces makes it easier to extend or modify the application in the future.
Asynchronous Programming
The application uses asynchronous programming (async and await) to improve performance and scalability, especially when dealing with I/O-bound operations like database queries and HTTP requests.
Conclusion
The StealCats project is built using modern, scalable technologies and adheres to best practices in software architecture. The combination of these technologies and design considerations ensures that the application is robust, maintainable, and ready for future enhancements.
